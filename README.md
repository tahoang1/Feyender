# Feyender

Our team aspired to create a product that would bring a difference to the lives of people with visual impairments. Our mobile application, Feyender, is designed to enhance and support the daily activities of our users. It recognizes objects in real time and provides an audible feedback. In addition, when the app detects a dangerous item, it warns the user. Feyender is an Android application that utilizes Google's Cloud Vision API and takes advantage of the powerful machine learning models to understand the content of an image. 

We plan to expand Feyender by adding voice input commands and a navigation system. We also plan to improve the machine learning model on the google cloud platform by validating the results of Feyender.
